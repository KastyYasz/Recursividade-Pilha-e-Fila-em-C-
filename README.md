This project was created during my Data Structures course, as part of my learning journey in C++.
It focuses on implementing a dynamic stack with basic operations (push, pop, peek, and empty/full checks)
and demonstrates how to use recursion to traverse and print the stack without losing its contents.

The code also reinforces key concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, constructors and destructors,
recursion, and error handling. It serves both as an academic exercise and as a foundation for building
more advanced data structure implementations in C++.
